### CBSD

Symptoms
Patches of dark brown or gray fungal growth on stems; necrotic areas covering buds on the stem
Cause
Fungus
Comments
Disease most commonly found on cassava grown in humid regions (e.g humid forest zones) and is less common in drier savanna areas; fungal spores are carried by wind to new plants and farms
Management
Only plant cassava cuttings taken from healthy plants which are free from necrotic lesions; space plants widely to allow good air circulation around plants and reduce disease incidence; remove weeds around plants; id disease is present, burn all necrotic stems and crop debris immediately after harvest to prevent spread

Symptoms
Leaves: 

- chlorotic or necrotic vein banding in mature leaves which may merge later to form large yellow patches

Stems:

- Brown elongated necrotic lesions on young stems

Tubers:

- necrosis of tubers

- roots develop knots

- internal tissues of roots and tubers stained brown and may rot due to secondary fungus infection

1. yellowing along veins on lower/older leaves ~ 3 months after planting
2. dark brown spots on upper green portion of stem ~ 6 months after planting
3. Severe cases- leaf drying, shoot die-back
4. In Tuber - Brown and hard rot when you cut into it. Causes malformation and root
constriction ~ 10 months after planting

Cause
Virus

Comments
Histroy and origin: Disease is prevalent in East Africa (Tanzania, Uganda and Kenya). It was first reported in 1930's in Tanzania and become endemic in later years. It is currently travelling from East Africa westwards and has been reported in the DRC. There is considerable concern that it will appear in the major West African growing regions, notably Nigeria. The virus is transmitted through whiteflies and stem cuttings. The origin of CBSD is suspected to have arisen from the viruses that are already present on the indigenous African flora. Virus structure and properties: The microscopic studies revealed that the virus is 650 nm long and earlier it was believe to be carlavirus. But further studies associate the virus to Ipomovirus. Cassva Brown Streak Disease is caused by two distinct species of single-stranded RNA (ssRNA) viruses, Cassava brown streak virus (CBSV) and Ugandan cassava brown streak virus (UCBSV), belonging to the genus Ipomovirus of the family Potyviridae. Economic loss: Cassava is an important stable crop in Africa and the continent produces an estimated 54% of the world's cassava production. As such the threat from CBSD seems inevitable due to its presence in many eastern African countries and its rate of transmission westwards to the major growing regions in Nigeria (which produced 30.8% of the world's supply). Though the economic loss from brown streak virus depends on region, cultivars and environment conditions, in general it is estimated up to 70% yield loss in susceptible variety is common with losses as high as 100% being observed in some regions. If the disease is unchecked it may cause 2 billion dollar in loss in Nigeria alone and lead to increase widespread poverty and malnutrition in West and Central Africa.

Symptoms
Discolored pale green, yellow or white mottled leaves which may be distorted with a reduced size; in highly susceptible cassava cultivars plant growth may be stunted, resulting in poor root yield and low quality stem cuttings. Note that infected plants can express a range of symptoms and the exact symptoms depend on the species of virus and the strain as well as the environmental conditions and and the sensitivity of the cassava host.

1. Patches of discolouration (chlorosis) in the leaves that vary from yellow to green.
2. The leaves display size variation and are often severely distorted.
3. Leaf blades sometimes fold depending on severity shrivel.

Cause
Virus
Comments
Disease is spread by infected cuttings and by whiteflies. The leaves are yellow, mottled and distorted. If leaves are yellow all over but are a normal size or there brown leaves that that does not indicate disease. Wild cassava (kisamvu cha mpira in Kiswahili) also hosts the disease. The disease was first observed in the late 19th Century in what is now Tanzania. It was not until work in 1938 that the disease transmission was confirmed to occur via grafting as well as vectored by the White fly.

### Cassava Bacterial Blight

Symptoms
Small, angular, brown, water-soaked lesions between leaf veins on lower surfaces of leaves; leaf blades turning brown as lesion expands; lesions may have a yello halo; lesions coalesce to form large necrotic patches; defoliation occurs with leaf petioles remaining in horizontal position as leaves drop; dieback of shoots; brown gum may be present on stems, leaves and petioles

Cause
Bacterium

Comments
Most important bacterial disease of cassava; spread by water splash and infected tools; disease more severe in wet conditions; particularly destructive in South America and Africa; most important method of spread is probably through exchange of infected plant cuttings
